# Chimera

Chimera is a general purpose achievement scalarizing function for multi-objective optimization [1]. User preferences regarding the objectives are expected in terms of an importance hierarchy, as well as relative tolerances on each objective indicating the degree of acceptable degradations. 

Here, we provide a stand-alone python implementation of Chimera which can be used as a wrapper for single-objective optimization algorithms. A usage example is provided at the bottom of `chimera.py`
