## SELFIES Example: Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) for chemistry
comparing SMILES, DeepSMILES, GrammarVAE and SELFIES representation using reconstruction quality, diversity and  latent space validity as metrics of interest

### information:
This is the original code used to generate the data in our paper. 

It used a hand-written SELFIES encoding (Table2 of paper), and cannot easily be adapted to other situations. If you want to use the VAE, please see ../chemistryVAE.py

That file is connected with the selfies.encoder/selfies.decoder, and can be applied on general datasets. For more documentation, please look there.
     
     
     settings*.yml
         these four files contain the settings for values for the best model described in the paper
